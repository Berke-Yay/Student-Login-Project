# Student-Login-Project
A demo student portal GUI created by Python

There is a class called student which defines the variables that a student should have and gets them via a constructor.
The gui is very simple, there is just a username and password part. A username of a student is the first three letters of his/her surname and name. The password is assigned when creating the student objects. If the username and password are correct, other information of students will be displayed. Else, the app will throw an alert.
